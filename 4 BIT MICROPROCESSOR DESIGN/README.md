# 4-Bit Microprocessor Design

This project was developed as the final assignment for ECEN 240 at BYU-Idaho. It implements a fully functional 4-bit microprocessor using digital logic modules such as ALU, ROM, registers, and a custom control unit.

## 🧠 Features
- 4-bit data path
- Custom instruction set architecture (ISA)
- ROM-based program storage
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Register File with read/write logic
- Top-level integration with control signals

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- SystemVerilog
- Vivado (or other simulation tools)
- GTKWave for waveform analysis

## 📁 Project Structure
- `verilog/`: All SystemVerilog modules and testbenches
- `docs/`: Final report and documentation
- `sim/`: Simulation outputs and waveforms

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Run simulation using Vivado or ModelSim
3. View waveform output using GTKWave
