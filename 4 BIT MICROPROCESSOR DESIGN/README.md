# ECEN-240
Collection of digital logic circuit designs and a 4-bit microprocessor implementation for ECEN 240

## Course Information

* **Course Name:** ECEN 240
* **Semester:** [Spring 2024]
* **University:** [Brigham Young University - Idaho]

## Project Description

This repository contains the project files for the ECEN 240 course. The project explores fundamental concepts in digital electronics and potentially culminates in the design and implementation of a 4-bit microprocessor.

The folders in this repository cover various topics, including:

* **REGISTER FILES:** [Designs and simulations related to register file implementations.]
* **COUNTERS:** [Implementations of different types of counters]
* **LATCHES AND FLIP FLOPS:** [ Designs and analysis of various latch and flip-flop circuits]
* **4 BIT MICROPROCESSOR DESIGN:** [Files related to the architecture, design, and potential simulation of a 4-bit microprocessor.]
* **DIGITAL VS ANALOG:** [Materials exploring the differences and conversions between digital and analog signals.]
* **INVERTERS:** [ Designs and analysis of inverter circuits.]
* **LOGIC GATES:** [Implementations and truth tables for basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR).]
* **SMALL SCALE ICS:** [ Exploration and usage of small-scale integrated circuits.]
* **ALU:** [ Design and implementation of an Arithmetic Logic Unit.]
